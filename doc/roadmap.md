# Roadmap

Objective: investigate f(n) of generic detectors for LET and other RQMs.

Always Monoenergetic, idealized condition, all in H2O:
1) Select typical photon-reponse curves: 1-hit high saturation, 1-hit low saturation, 2-hit supralinear detector.
2) Select range of particles (z,E): 1 <= z <= 10. E matching ranges up to maybe 35 cm in H2O.
3) Define relevant RQMs (LET, Q, Qeff, T).
4) Select RDD: Kraft/Scholz.
5) CPP, calculate track overlap distributions for relevant fluence ranges (e.g. 1e8 - 1e12 /cmÂ²)
6) Calculate f(n) plots, which show non-linearity as a function of fluence. (This is not quenching relative to photon-reference, but relative to linear fluence proportionality.)
7) Repeat 4-6 for every RQM (properly spaced)
8) Repeat 4-7 for every z.
9) Plot f(n) maps Phi vs RQM.
10) Investigate maps, iso-contours for f(n) 0.98-1.02
11) ???
12) Profit

## Further Exploration
- specific detectors and detector materials
- point dose vs extended target dose (adds target size as parameter)
- add single ion beam "quenching"
- formalism to keep a) cavity theory separate from b) quenching and c) track-overlap. Think, is b and c really the same?
